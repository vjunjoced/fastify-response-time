Add `X-Response-Time` header at each request for Fastify. The unit used is milliseconds.

Add `Server-Timing` header, that could be used to pass timing server to client (useful to debug).
You could find some documentation at [W3C Server-Timing](https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/) documentation.

**You need to use Fastify version 0.31 or newer, the hook used (onSend) was added in this version**

_If you need older Fastify version, use version 1.0.1 of this plugin_

this is a test for the nestjs framework

## Install

``
npm install --save fastify-response-time
``

## Usage

Add it to you project with `register` and you are done!

```javascript
// Register the plugin
fastify.register(require("fastify-response-time"));

// Define a new route in hapijs notation
fastify.route({
  method: "GET",
  url: "/header-hapi",
  handler: (request, reply) => {
    reply.send();
  }
});

// Define a new route in express notation
fastify.get("/header-express", (request, reply) => {
  reply.send();
});

// Add server timing information
fastify.get("/header-express", (request, reply) => {
  reply.setServerTiming("cache", 5.3, "Cache read");
  reply.send();
});
```

Both examples responds with:

    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Content-Length: 17
    < X-Response-Time: 0.08
    < Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2017 21:14:33 GMT
    < Connection: keep-alive
    <

## Options

This plugin allow you to specify options:

- `header` can be used to change default header name to something else _(`X-Response-Time` by default)_
- `digits` to specify the number of digits in the response _(`2` by default, so 1.03)_

## `reply.setServerTiming` usage

`reply.setServerTiming( name , duration , description ) => boolean`

With:

* `name`: _[mandatory]_ the name of the measure, and must be unique. Any already existing value will not be replaced
* `duration`: _[optional]_ the duration, that must be an integer or float. If not needed, pass `0` or `null`
* `description`: _[optional]_ the description is needed. It must be a string
* return `true` if the measure is added the the list that will be send with the request, `false` is the name already
  exists

The response will be:

    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < Content-Type: application/json
    < Content-Length: 17
    < X-Response-Time: 0.08
    < Server-Timing: cache;dur=5.3;desc="Cache read"
    < Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2017 21:14:33 GMT
    < Connection: keep-alive
    <
